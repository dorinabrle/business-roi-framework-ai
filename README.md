# Business ROI Framework for Tech & AI Projects

A practical guide for translating technical innovation into business value - whether you're building AI infrastructure, developer tools, or any technology that needs to justify its existence.

## Why This Exists

You've built something brilliant. Your fellow developers think it's genius. Your GitHub stars are climbing. 

Maybe you're just building for the joy of it - and that's completely valid. Open source doesn't exist to make money.

But sometimes the questions come anyway: "Could this be a business?" "What's the ROI (return on investment)?" "How do we justify this to management?" Maybe from your manager, maybe from peers, maybe from your own curiosity about what's possible.

This framework exists for those moments. Not because every project needs to make money, but because when you DO need to translate "this is technically superior" into "this makes business sense," you shouldn't have to figure it out alone.

I've coached 200+ startups through this exact translation. This is for when you're ready - or when someone's asking and you need answers.

**Current focus:** The examples lean heavily toward AI infrastructure (LLMs, cost optimization, etc.) because that's what we're building right now with [cascadeflow](https://github.com/lemony-ai/cascadeflow). But the underlying logic works for any technology - developer tools, infrastructure, B2B software. I'm working on adding more generic examples across different domains.

## What's Inside

**[3-Question Framework](./3-question-framework.md)** - Translate any technical feature into business value in about 5 minutes. No MBA required.

**[Cost Model Template](./cost-model-template.md)** - A spreadsheet that doesn't make you hate spreadsheets. Plug in numbers, get ROI.

**[Vendor Evaluation Rubric](./vendor-evaluation-rubric.md)** - Beyond GitHub stars: what actually matters when someone's spending real money or betting production on it.

**[Red Flags Checklist](./red-flags-checklist.md)** - Things I wish the startups I coached had known before they built their "enterprise-ready" prototype.

## Who This Is For

**If you're building for the joy of it** - keep doing that. Not everything needs to be a business, and that's perfectly fine.

**If you're curious whether your project could be a product** - this helps you figure out if there's a viable business (and if you even want to pursue that).

**If someone's asking you business questions** - whether that's a manager, a potential customer, or a curious peer - this gives you a framework to answer without pretending to be something you're not.

**If you're evaluating solutions** for your team and need to justify it to budget holders - this helps you build that case.

This framework is here when you need it, not to convince you that you need it.

## How to Use This

1. Start with the **3-Question Framework** to translate your tech into business terms
2. Use the **Cost Model Template** to build your actual ROI case
3. Check the **Red Flags Checklist** to avoid common pitfalls
4. Use the **Vendor Evaluation Rubric** when choosing solutions (or positioning yours)

Or just grab what you need and ignore the rest. I'm not your manager.

## A Quick Note on Numbers

All examples use realistic ranges from actual startups and companies I've worked with. Your mileage will vary. If someone promises you 90% cost reduction with zero effort, that's not a vendor-that's a carnival barker.

## Want More?

Looking for a specific template? Have a use case I didn't cover? Let me know. I'll continue adding guidelines, frameworks, and examples based on what's actually useful.

Open an issue or reach out - I'm building this based on real needs, not theoretical completeness.

## Example: How We Use This at Lemony

When we built [cascadeflow](https://github.com/lemony-ai/cascadeflow) (an open source tool for AI cost optimization through token-level speculative cascading), we used this exact framework to figure out:

- **The pain:** Companies spending $200K+/year on LLM APIs with no visibility into optimization opportunities
- **The savings:** 40-85% cost reduction with no quality loss  
- **The ROI (return on investment):** Takes 6+ months of specialized expertise in LLM routing, caching strategies, and prompt optimization to build yourself - expertise most teams don't have

The framework helped us go from "cool technical solution" to "here's why this matters for your AWS bill." It's MIT licensed and free to use.

Created by [Dorina Buehrle](https://github.com/yourusername) - CBO/CFO at Lemony (building [cascadeflow](https://github.com/lemony-ai/cascadeflow)), fractional CFO for startups, PhD in Business Innovation, professional translator of "but the architecture is really clean" into "here's the business case."

**A note on philosophy:** Not every project needs to be a business. Some of the best things in open source exist because someone wanted to solve a problem or build something interesting. This framework is here for when you want it or need it, not to convince you that everything should be monetized. Build for the joy of building. Use this when business questions come up.
